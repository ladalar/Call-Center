## Overview
This C++ program simulates a call center scenario using pthreads and semaphores. The simulation involves customers (threads) interacting with a limited number of operators. The goal is to showcase synchronization using semaphores to manage operator availability.

Code is based on: [Java Threads Synchronization with Semaphore](https://lauraliparulo.altervista.org/java-threads-synchronization-with-semaphore/)
